Components:

#Homs : Home component containing all important details and histogram too

#Footer,#Contact, #Detail : Not much used just to make it complete and I used Router links to make it navigatable



Website is fully responsive ! 
Use of reacthooks are there 

React-csv module was used to download csv from the table I created using js map()

basic concepts and functions of js are used  like:

1.Object.entries() : to convert object into array

2.Object.fromEntries() : to convert back array into js object/dictionary

3.slice function to pick initial 20 elements

4.sort method to sort data in decreasing order so that I can get highest frequency first


Histogram is used as separate component and hook value is transferred to it with the help of props


How to operate?

npm start 

when home page opens there is a fetch button , click on it first then only data will be fetched from the url provided by the company, and then histogram will be made

 scroll more there is an 'export' button below table, click on that to download csv file just as in the table!!

 Contact details: Available in contact page , you can click on that and check



 Note: flexbox is used intensively to make interface responsive and easy to operate
 Used where? : In navigation bar , in making histogram


 npm modules are used but third party plugins are not used as such.
