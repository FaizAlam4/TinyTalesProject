Components:

#Homs : Home component containing all important details and histogram too

#Footer,#Contact, #Detail : Not much used just to make it complete and I used Router links to make it navigatable



Website is fully responsive ! 
Use of reacthooks are there 

React-csv module was used to download csv from the table I created using js map()

basic concepts and functions of js are used  like:

1.Object.entries() : to convert object into array

2.Object.fromEntries() : to convert back array into js object/dictionary

3.slice function to pick initial 20 elements

4.sort method to sort data in decreasing order so that I can get highest frequency first


Histogram is used as separate component and hook value is transferred to it with the help of props
